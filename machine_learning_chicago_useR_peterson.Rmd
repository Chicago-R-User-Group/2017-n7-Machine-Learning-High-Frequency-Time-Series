# Introductions

## *Who is this Guy ?* { .smaller .columns-2 }

__Brian Peterson:__

- quant, author, open source advocate
- [DV Trading](http://dvtrading.co) Partner | Head Trader | Automated Trading Strategies
- Senior Lecturer (Part-Time), University of Washington [Computational Finance and Risk Management](http://depts.washington.edu/compfin/)
- author or co-author of over 10 packages for using R in Finance
- organization admin for [**R**](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/)'s participation in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

__Proprietary Trading:__

- proprietary or principal traders are a specific "member" structure with the exchanges
- high barriers to entry, large up-front capital requirements
- many strategies pursued in this structure have capacity constraints
- benefits on the other side are low fees, potentially high leverage
- money management needs to be very focused on drawdowns, leverage, volatility

## So what is Machine Learning?

- after Artificial Intelligence models failed to produce human-like intelligence

- Machine Learning was adopted as the term to include a huge range of (mostly) non-parametric computational inference models

- the goal is to provide inference from data

- lives at the intersection of computer science and statistics

see:

- Domingos [-@Domingos2015] *The Master Algorithm*

- Efron & Hastie [-@Efron2016] *Computer Age Statistical Inference*

for book-length treatments.


# Data and Features

## So it's all about the data? {.columns-2}

- market data capture going from ~100GB/day to ~1+TB/day as more information sent by exchanges

- many vendors, including huge players like Reuters and IBM, are providing additional parsed data sources

- top users of ML in trading are collecting, curating, and cultivating rare or private data sources

- now common to have tens to hundreds of additional descriptive time series in addition to market data

![](../other_talks/machine_learning.png)
https://xkcd.com/1838/ ^[alt-text: "The pile gets soaked with data and starts to get mushy over time, so it's technically recurrent."]


## What about the Features?

- how do we go from descriptive to predictive?

- the raw data is usually not the main feature in time series prediction

- feature selection [@Guyon2003] ranks and filters multiple possible features

- it is often better to first engage in pro-active feature engineering:

    - transformation of data to regularize scale, variation
    - coding of data into categorical or integer states
    - adding features that are indicative of the objective
    - using extra models for things like seasonality or colinearity
    

# About the Models

## Rules Engines

- rules created by experts have largely fallen out of favor  (*or have they?*)

- knowledge engineering and expert systems enjoyed a brief ascendancy in the 1980's 

- notably before computers were fast enough to employ statistical approaches

- many of the most successful users of ML spend significant time and money crafting features from data

- perhaps knowledge encoded as features is the most important legacy of the expert systems

- Decision Tree R Packages:  [rpart](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) [party](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/party/index.html) [randomForest](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) 

## Optimization {.smaller}

- almost all machine learning has its roots in optimization

- many algorithms use optimization solvers or parts of optimization solvers

- optimization is also valuable in this context because it is one of the most common ML use cases

- for overviews of (primarily) convex optimization see the Simon's Institute talks by Ben Recht [ -@Recht2013i,  [-@Recht2013ii] ]

- global stochastic models can handle non-smooth objectives, e.g.

    - Particle Swarms [@Kennedy2011], e.g. [pso](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pso) 
    - Simulated Annealing [@Kirkpatrick1983], e.g. [genSA](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genSA)
    - Genetic Algos like Differential Evolution [@Price2006, @Zhang2009], e.g. [DEoptim](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DEoptim)
    
... and *learn* or adapt as they gather more data

## Gradient Descent

- gradient descent is the preference to move towards a local minima 

- used widely in solving optimization problems

- the famous Perceptron [@Rosenblatt1958] is a gradient descent algorithm (and also the original neural network)

- information on Momentum for gradient descent in @Goh2017

- [policy gradients](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Policy_gradient_methods) are formed
  when you add parameters to gradient descent, and update optimal parameters as more data is examined
  
- policy gradients are the key mechanism utilized to construct reinforcement learning agent based models

- see packages [ReinforcementLearning](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ReinforcementLearning/), [MDPtoolbox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MDPtoolbox), and [gym](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gym)

## Back Propagation

- backpropagation is the adjustment of previously established views or connections based on how new data differs from expectations

- related to policy gradients and gradient descent, 

- the most famous models employing backpropagation are neural networks

- 'deep learning' is a neural network with more layers, requiring bigger computers and more data

- one of the oldest true 'learning' approaches as the model adapts itself [@Chauvin1995, @Horikawa1992]

- host of different neural network flavors, implemented in [neuralnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neuralnet), [keras](https://rstudio.github.io/keras/), [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/)

## Evolution (Crossover & Mutation)

- all stochastic optimizers are to some degree population based

- evolutionary algorithms adopt this language from biology

- features critical to 'learning' optimizers are crossover and mutation

- crossover is the mixing of features from more successful trials [@Spears1992, @Spears1993]

- mutation randomizes features (even if successful) to avoid local minima

- look at global solvers such as [DEoptim](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DEoptim) or [pso](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pso)

## Similarity

- similarity between training set and sample used to draw inferences

- applicable to both Euclidian and non-Euclidian feature spaces

- after pairwise similarity methodology is set, no need for access to the features themselves

- applied to regression, classification, and ranking [@Chen2009]

- [k-means clusters](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/kmeans.html), [SVM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/) models, [kernel](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KernSmooth/) models all used to build similarity models

## Probabalistic Inference

- relationships between variables may often be known only with a certain probability

- state transitions also occur with a certain observable probability even if the underlying causes are unknown

- inference from these probabilities is the core of Monte Carlo, Bayesian methods [@Cooper1990, @Neal1993]

- inherently computationally intensive in ways that some earlier learning approaches were not

- see [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) (and [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/))


## Compute Implications

- choose a technology stack to build on 

    - R, python
    - libraries such as TensorFlow, AzureML, mlr, scikit-learn
    - the heavy lifting is done with compiled code
    - cluster architecture (OpenStack, AWS, Azure, Google Compute) 
    - use specialized hardware where appropriate (e.g. GPU, TPU, ASIC)
    
- normalize all data access and metadata

    - specialized time series databases (e.g. InfluxDB, Timebase, OneTick, kdb, Streambase)
    - catalog all the data, version it

- build a process for continuously evaluating models [@Breck2016]

# Getting It Wrong

## Evaluating Overfitting in Machine Learning {.smaller}

Classical measures:

- specialized *t*-tests for ML algorithms
- cross-validation (but this makes the *t*-test challenging)
- *p*-value (but subject to *p*-hacking [@Head2015])
- multiple-hypothesis testing (beware of false discovery rate [@Efron2016, Ch. 15])
- mean squared forecast error (MSFE, RMSE)
- resampled errors (bootstrap, permutation tests, etc.)

ML-specific measures [@Japkowicz2011]:

- Confusion Matrix 
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots/stats or the related Cost Curves

<div class="centered">
*Make sure that you can inspect the choices your model is making!*
</div>

## Detecting Overfitting in Backtests {.smaller}

Multiple tests focused on overfitting of backtests also exist:

- **Walk Forward Analysis** : @Pardo2008 in [quantstrat](https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat)
- **Equity Curve Monte Carlo** : @Tomasini2009 in [blotter](https://github.com/braverock/blotter)
- **Round Turn Trade Monte Carlo** : @Peterson2015 in [quantstrat](https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat)
- **White's Reality Check** : from @White2000 and @Hansen2005 in [ttrTests](https://www.r-bloggers.com/tag/ttrtests)
- **k-fold cross validation** : randomly divide the sample of size $T$ into sequential 
  sub-samples of size $T/k$. [@Hastie2009]
- **CSCV sampling** (combinatorially symmetric cross validation): "generate $S/2$ testing sets of size $T/2$ by recombining the $S$ slices of the overall sample of size $T$ ". [@Bailey2014probability, p.17] in [pbo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbo)
- **Multiple Hypothesis Testing** looks at Type I vs Type II error in evaluating 
  backtests and at appropriate haircuts based on these probabilities. [@Harvey2013backtesting ] in [quantstrat](https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat)



# Using Machine Learning in Trading

*A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science*. - Robert Gentleman

## Regression

- regression results may be the most common uses of machine learning 

- you want the algorithm to estimate the value (mean/median), slope, etc. of some variable

- you may do this directly (e.g. [logistic regression](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/glm.html), Bayesian regression via [Stan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/), [Random Forest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest), [Boost](
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mboost))

- or indirectly (MCMC, gradient descent, [state space model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/), optimization model with the correct objective)

- in many cases, simpler regression models (e.g. [dlm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlm), [ridge regression](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/penalized), [LASSO](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lars)) may do just as well

## Optimization

- not just a model feature, optimization is often the end goal

- consider whether simpler linear/quadratic/gradient optimizers will work -- less model risk

- optimizer parameters for global optimizers can have huge impacts on model outputs and computation

- many problems may be recast as optimization problems:

    - capital allocation, see [PortfolioAnalytics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PortfolioAnalytics)
    - risk management, see PortfolioAnalytics and [PerformanceAnalytics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PerformanceAnalytics)
    - adaptive parameters
    - (optimal) process control, see [gym](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gym) and [MDPtoolbox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MDPtoolbox)
    
## Classification / Clustering

- separation of observations into groups or states is classification or clustering [@Japkowicz2011]

- many ML models are used as classifiers

- proceeding from simple models is usually advisable

- key goal is typically to *label* the observed data or state

- so that some other model can take action based on that label/state

- common classification uses:

    - volatility regimes, e.g. [Markov Switching GARCH](https://github.com/keblu/MSGARCH)
    - country/sector/volatility clustering
    - bull/bear market classification
    - trending/consolidating market
    
## Composite Models

- lots of little models

- ensembles, boosting, weak learners

- in trading, this means mostly feature engineering

- or combining weak alpha trading models

- Worldquant [@Tulchinsky2015], Kepos (Carhart/Litterman), Jump, Renaissance, Bridgewater, Citadel, others all doing this to one degree or another

&nbsp;

<div class="centered">
*Doing this well takes scale!*
</div>

## Model Discovery

- use the ML model to *discover* trading strategies
- given market data, build trading rules

&nbsp;

- the 'Holy Grail' of ML in trading

&nbsp;


<div class="centered">
*Like the Grail, mostly a myth*
</div>

&nbsp;

## Machine Learning in Trading {.smaller}

- "targeted" machine learning is all around us (e.g. voice recognition, face recognition)
- some of the most spectacular advances for large scale ML have been games (Jeopardy, Chess, Go, DOTA2) 
- those wins had huge custom built computers behind them, doing *online* ML

&nbsp;

- most uses of ML in Trading are *offline*, 

    - models trained on large data, clusters, GPU's, TPU's
    - model parameters then fixed for 24 hours or more
    
- or use a simplified *online* model that updates state but does not refit model parameters



- feature engineering is what makes models work

- many good features and data sets make model 'discovery' possible

- focus on curating your data, building features

- with enough data, models, and features, you have broad choice of algorithms

# Case Study

## Digression: Google Summer of Code {.smaller}

- [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is an annual program

- students write open source code for the summer with the assistance of project mentors 

- students compete for slots each summer that take the place of an industry internship

- students get paid a [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) by Google

- [**R**](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/) has participated for 12 of the 13 years the program has existed

- several student projects in **R** GSoC each year are Finance and/or Machine Learning related:

    - [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp)
    - financial graphics
    - evaluating estimation errors for performance and risk
    - porting matlab code from Dowd, Meucci, others
    - [research replication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319298241_Research_Replication)
    - extending machine learning libraries like [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr), [Keras](https://github.com/rstudio/keras), Stan, Tensorflow, and others


## High Frequency Data

- large
- noisy
- non-stationary

&nbsp;

- 10's to 100's of GB of data per day per market
- millions to billions of observations per instrument
- time-alignment issues across markets and data sources

## Implementation: Rmarkdown

- we extensively use *rmarkdown*[@Rmarkdown] for repeatable, compileable documents
- write documentation and code together in one document
- and research and production reports
- we find it easier to use than the older [Sweave](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr)
- well supported for development and testing via RStudio
- I use it extensively for presentations (like this one! code available upon request)


## Implementation: Time Series Data {.smaller}

- we use *xts*[@xts2017] for time series data in **R**
- *plot.xts* written by Ross Bennett, is massively faster than *ggplot2*[@ggplot2_2016]

&nbsp;

Critical features for dealing with time series:

- easy merging of data by time/date index
- easy subsetting using [ISO-8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/)
- can handle billions of rows, unlike the *tidyverse*[@tidyverse]

&nbsp;

- the Tayal replication is a *small* study, and used 101 M rows of data, ~10GB uncompressed
- training windows on individual instruments contained several million rows
- feature processing reduced dimensionality to ~10k features per day per symbol

## Digression: History of Monte Carlo analysis

- Laplace was the first to describe the mathematical properties of sampling from a distribution
- Mahalanobis extended this work in the 1930's to describe sampling from dependent distributions, and anticipated the block bootstrap by examining these dependencies
- Monte Carlo simulation was developed by Stan Ulam and John von Neumann (with computation by Françoise Ulam) as part of the hydrogen bomb program in 1946 (Richard Rhodes, **Dark Sun**, p.304)
- computational implementation of Monte Carlo simulation was constructed by Nicholas Metropolis on the ENIAC and MANIAC machines 
- Metropolis was an author in 1953 of the prior distribution sampler extended by W.K Hastings to the modern Metropolis-Hastings form in 1970
- Maurice Quenouille and John Tukey developed 'jackknife' simulation in the 1950's
- Bradley Efron described the modern bootstrap in 1979

## Hidden Markov Models

- many processes are only partially observable
- inputs are known, but may be incomplete
- outputs are observable, but may be probabilistic and/or noisy

&nbsp;

- Hidden Markov Models combine a discrete state model with an output or observation model
- transitions between states are governed by a 'chained' Markov state
- probability of being in one state or another can be computed at each observation


## Implementation: Stan 

- [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a domain specific language (DSL) for doing Bayesian inference
- named for Stan Ulam

&nbsp;

- given an unknown quantity $\phi$ sample from a probability distribution with a state transition matrix
- in theory (potentially given infinite time and a sufficiently good guess), the sample distribution will converge on the unknown distribution
- the primary sampling method used in Stan is called *Hamiltonian* Monte Carlo 
- the Hamiltonian sampler[@Neal2011] will typically perform better than the older, simpler Gibbs sampler or the Metropolis-Hastings sampler for high-dimensional problems or problems with multiple parameters

## Implementation: Stan Models

- all Stan models consist of a specification of the *data*, a set of *parameters*, and a *model* which describes the sampling and transition matrix

```{stan, output.var="stan", eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

data {
  int<lower=1> T;                   // number of observations (length)
  int<lower=1> K;                   // number of hidden states
  real x_t[T];                      // observations
}

parameters {
  // Discrete state model
  simplex[K] p_1k;                  // initial state probabilities
  simplex[K] A_ij[K];               // transition probabilities
                                    // A_ij[i][j] = p(z_t = j | z_{t-1} = i)

  // Continuous observation model
  ordered[K] mu_k;                  // observation means
  real<lower=0> sigma_k[K];         // observation standard deviations
}

```

## Implementation: HMM {.smaller}

- the model draws from a generative path using the transition probabilities

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE }
runif_simplex <- function(T) {
  x <- -log(runif(T))
  x / sum(x)
}

hmm_generate <- function(K, T) {
  # 1. Parameters
  p_1k <- runif_simplex(K)
  A_ij <- t(replicate(K, runif_simplex(K)))
  mu_k <- sort(rnorm(K, 10 * 1:K, 1))
  sigma_k <- abs(rnorm(K))

  # 2. Hidden path
  z_t <- vector("numeric", T)

  z_t[1] <- sample(1:K, size = 1, prob = p_1k)
  for (t in 2:T)
    z_t[t] <- sample(1:K, size = 1, prob = A_ij[z_t[t - 1], ])

  # 3. Observations
  x_t <- vector("numeric", T)
  for (t in 1:T)
    x_t[t] <- rnorm(1, mu_k[z_t[t]], sigma_k[z_t[t]])

  list(x_t = x_t, z_t = z_t,
       theta = list(p_1k = p_1k, A_ij = A_ij,
                    mu_k = mu_k, sigma_k = sigma_k))
}
```

- note that this model draws from a Gaussian prior, and is controlling the transition matrix to get differentiation

- see https://github.com/luisdamiano/stancon18/ for a full tutorial on HMM in Stan

## How to make useful predictions from features? { .smaller }

<div class="centered">
*[...] some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used.* [@Domingos2012]
</div>

A plain __HMM__ is a probabilistic learner of the unobserved dynamics behind a sequence of discrete features. The Tayal __HHMM__ maps the features and the corresponding learned states into bull and bear markets by establishing a hierarchy.

__The strengths of the features__:

- __Underlying theory__: representative of beliefs about how markets work (interactions between price and volume)
- __Statistical properties__: captures non-linearities in a simple, parsimonious, and tractable way
- __Noise reduction__: by discretization
- __Computational complexity__: improved by reducing data set size
- __Empirical support__: when applied on real data, results are consistent with empirical evidence

We test the model out of sample. After one feature (a "zig-zag") ends, we predict the next state. We buy one unit in bull states and sell one unit in bear states.

## Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model | __Bayesian Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models applied to financial time series__ [@Damiano2017] <br /> based on __Regime Switching and Technical Trading with Dynamic Bayesian Networks in High-Frequency Stock Markets__ [@Tayal2009] { .smaller .columns-2 }

__Problem__: predicting price trends systematically in a profitable way

__Stylized Facts__:

- Market behavior is complex and partially unknown
- Non-linear interactions between price and volume
- Multi-resolution: short-term trends within long-term trends
- High-frequency: noisy and large data sets need fast online computations

__A Proposal__: ensemble of statistical and machine learning techniques

1. Create intermediate indicator variables
2. Combine them into discrete features using technical analysis rules
3. Build a hierarchy to link all the features in a logical way
4. Apply clustering with Markovian memory

## Case Study Feature Detail { .smaller .columns-2 .smallmathslide .smalltableslide }

__(1)__ Identify local extrema, where $e_n$ is the price at the extreme.

__(2)__ Create intermediate variables $\nu, \ \tilde{\nu}$ and features $f_n^0$ direction, $f_n^1$ price trend, $f_n^2$ volume trend.

\[
f_n^0 =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if $e_n$ is a local maximum (positive zig-zag)} \\
-1 & \text{if $e_n$ is a local minimum (negative zig-zag),} \\
\end{cases}
\]

\[
f_n^1 =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if $e_{n-4} < e_{n-2} < e_{n} \wedge e_{n-3} < e_{n-1}$ (up-trend)} \\
-1 & \text{if $e_{n-4} > e_{n-2} > e_{n} \wedge e_{n-3} > e_{n-1}$ (down-trend)} \\
 0 & \text{otherwise (no trend).}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\nu_n^1 = \frac{\phi_n}{\phi_{n-1}}, \quad \nu_n^2 = \frac{\phi_n}{\phi_{n-2}}, \quad \nu_n^3 = \frac{\phi_{n-1}}{\phi_{n-2}}, \quad
\tilde{\nu}_n^j =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if $\nu_n^j - 1 > \alpha$} \\
-1 & \text{if $1 - \nu_n^j > \alpha$} \\
 0 & \text{if $|\nu_n^j - 1| \le \alpha$}, \\
\end{cases}
\]

\[
f_n^2 =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if $\tilde{\nu}_n^1 = 1, \tilde{\nu}_n^2 > -1, \tilde{\nu}_n^3 < 1$ (volume strengthens)} \\
-1 & \text{if $\tilde{\nu}_n^1 = -1, \tilde{\nu}_n^2 < -1, \tilde{\nu}_n^3 > -1$ (volume weakens)} \\
 0 & \text{otherwise (volume is indeterminant)}. \\
\end{cases}
\]

__(3)__ Combine into 18 meaningful features using the following table. They will be linked hierarchically by the model.

## Results { .figslide .mediumfig .smaller}

Back tested on 12 stocks, 17 days, 7 configurations: $12 \times 17 \times 7 = 1,428$ out of sample daily returns.

- For most stocks, HHMM outperforms buy & hold (B&H).
- Returns virtually uncorrelated with B&H.
- Sometimes HHMM offers less variance than B&H (further research needed).
